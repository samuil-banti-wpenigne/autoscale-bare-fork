== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= Why is having a fast site important? =


A fast site is crucial for several reasons. When a website loads quickly, visitors are more likely to stay engaged, explore more pages, and convert into customers. Additionally, site speed is a key factor in search engine rankings, influencing your website's visibility on platforms like Google. Faster-loading sites not only satisfy users but also contribute to improved SEO, making it essential for overall online success.


= Why is NitroPack better than other caching solutions? =


NitroPack differentiates itself from traditional caching solutions with its advanced optimization capabilities and cloud-based infrastructure, which extends beyond the limitations of WordPress hosting servers. It is recognized for achieving the highest pass rates in [Core Web Vitals technology report](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/55bc8fad-44c2-4280-aa0b-5f3f0cd3d2be/page/M6ZPC?params=%7B%22df44%22:%22include%25EE%2580%25800%25EE%2580%2580IN%25EE%2580%2580ALL%25EE%2580%2580WordPress%25EE%2580%2580Shopify%25EE%2580%2580Wix%25EE%2580%2580Squarespace%25EE%2580%2580NitroPack%22%7D), alongside top Lighthouse scores. This performance underscores NitroPack's effectiveness in enhancing user experience and website speed, establishing its leadership in the optimization space.


= Can NitroPack replace all caching, code and image optimization and speed plugins? =


Yes! NitroPack is an [all-in-one](https://nitropack.io/page/features?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=WP-plugin) solution for optimizing websites. It implements dozens of speed optimization techniques, from simple minification to JS delay and critical CSS generation for frontend optimization and built-in CDN for backend optimization. However, it's important to note that while NitroPack is effective in replacing many page caching related solutions, it may not cover aspects like Object caching solutions. There is no need to run another plugin alongside NitroPack to enjoy the benefits of effective site speed optimization.


= Is NitroPack suitable for all WordPress sites? =


From service websites to blogs to advanced ecommerce platforms – NitroPack provides optimal speed and performance optimization for any and all WordPress and WooCommerce websites.


= Is WooCommerce supported? =


Yes, NitroPack is fully compatible with [WooCommerce](https://nitropack.io/platform/woocommerce?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=WP-plugin). It intelligently caches and optimizes eCommerce websites without disrupting their functionality. WooCommerce site owners can also leverage special features like the [Cart Cache](https://nitropack.io/blog/post/ecommerce-cart-cache?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=WP-plugin&utm_content=ecommerce-cart-cache), which ensures page optimization persists even when items are added to the cart.


= Does NitroPack optimize mobile pages also? =


Absolutely, NitroPack optimizes both desktop and mobile pages, ensuring a fast, smooth experience across all devices. Not only that, but NitroPack actually tailors its optimizations based on the device type in order to achieve maximum performance.


= How long does it take to see the results after installing NitroPack? =


You'll see immediate improvements in website speed after installing NitroPack. Test your site with tools like Google PageSpeed Insights, Pingdom, and GTmetrix to witness the positive impact.


While many optimizations show instant results, please note that the Core Web Vitals report may take up to 28 days to fully reflect your scores. This is because Core Web Vitals rely on real user data for accurate measurement taken in the last 28 days.


= Can NitroPack help me boost and pass Core Web Vitals? =


Absolutely. NitroPack is designed to improve all Core Web Vitals metrics: Largest Contentful Paint, First Input Delay, Cumulative Layout Shift and Interaction to Next Paint. By addressing these key factors, NitroPack ensures a substantial improvement in your Performance score in PageSpeed Insights, providing a significant boost to your website's overall performance.


= How does NitroPack handle updates and compatibility with new WordPress versions? =


NitroPack is regularly updated to ensure compatibility with the latest WordPress versions. Updates are provided to enhance features, security, and overall performance. Review the latest one [here](https://wordpress.org/plugins/nitropack/#developers).


= Can I test NitroPack before committing to a plan? =


Absolutely! Start with our free plan to experience NitroPack's speed and performance optimizations in action before making a commitment. 


= What types of caching does NitroPack use? =


NitroPack employs both server-side caching and client-side caching. Server-side caching involves storing pre-generated HTML files to reduce server load and response times. On the client side, NitroPack leverages browser caching to store static assets locally on a user's device, minimizing the need for repeated downloads and further optimizing page load times.


= How does NitroPack handle dynamic content caching? =


NitroPack intelligently manages dynamic content caching by utilizing sophisticated algorithms to identify which parts of a page can be cached without compromising real-time updates. This ensures that dynamic elements on your website, such as recent posts or user-specific information, remain current while still benefiting from caching optimizations.


= I have more questions. Can you help me? =
Yes, our dedicated support team is available to assist you with any questions that you may have. They can also lend a hand in the setup of your NitroPack account, ensuring a hassle-free, time-saving experience.


= Does the plugin have any third-party resources? =
